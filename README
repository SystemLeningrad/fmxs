NIGHTMAREMAIL 0.1.1 RELEASE NOTES

NightmareMail 0.1.1 was rushed out during the early stages of writing a new
Redo-based build system. You will need to run

   make -f Makefile.legacy

rather than the usual make invocation to build this software.

Other than that, the install process is no different to before:

   ${EDITOR} conf-* #to tweak cc, ld, qmailhome etc for your system
   make -f Makefile.legacy -j 2 it
   doas make -f Makefile.legacy setup check
   (then fix file permissions back up in the source directory)

Check your control files are in good order and restart your queue daemon,
and you'll be ready to go.

NightmareMail 0.1 and below are insecure as they produce backscatter spam.
Do not use them on the public Internet. Upgrade right away if you use MXF
on the public Internet.

Paul Jarc (PRJ)'s realrcptto patch,
https://code.dogmap.org./qmail/#realrcptto, is incorporated into MXF 0.1.1.
Paul Jarc placed this patch into the public domain. Thanks Paul! This
should reduce backscatter spam, which is a problem my friend Lightning
at Ultradian Club has been experiencing with his mailserver.

NIGHTMAREMAIL 0.1 RELEASE NOTES

As stated in doc/README.mxf, I've obtained a license from the developer of
qmail-dnsbl. qmail-dnsbl is now a part of MXF. Thanks Fabio! I reproduce
the text of the email in which he licensed the patch to me below.

   Hi Ellenor

   feel free to download, use, modify, and redistribute the qmail-dnsbl
  patch at your own risk, as it doesn't come with any warranty and it's
  not actively maintained.
   I hope this could be useful for your scope.

   Best,
   Fabio

I interpret this as a rough 3 clause BSD license, but if you're Fabio and
that's a misinterpretation, I am willing to be corrected.
